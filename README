This is a project for building a Turnkey Linux patch to configure a
Turnkey Linux installation of Ubuntu 10.04 (initially) along with the following additions:

- Musicbrainz server (in slave mode)


NOTES
==================================================================
musicbrainz is configured as follows:
- musicbrainz is served by nginx from the /var/www/musicbrainz directory
- after deploying the system and validating network access, you must:
    - log on as root and run "/root/setup_musicbrainz" to load
      the database from the latest exports available at musicbrainz.org


DONATIONS
==================================================================
If you want to send donations to keep this work going, please send them to
the authours of musicbrainz and/or Turnkey Linux.
They are the heroes in this effort, not me.


USAGE
==================================================================
This patch should be applied onto version 11.3 of the 
Turnkey core distribution found at:
http://www.turnkeylinux.org/core

This can be done be either installing the core appliance and applying the patch

OR

by patching the installable ISO image of the distribution

tklpatch turnkey-core-11.2-lucid-x86.iso tklpatch/musicbrainz
